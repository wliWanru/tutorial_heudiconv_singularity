# tutorial_heudiconv_singularity
a naive tutorial about how to convert heudiconv docker image to singularity image, and how to use singularity version of heudiconv to convert dicom files to BIDS files

# introduction
this tutorial was mainly create for running fMRI data preprocessing on Cluster, which only takes singularity container. 

I'd like to express my sincere thanks to the authors of heudiconv (https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv) and docker2singularity (https://github.com/singularityhub/docker2singularity)!
